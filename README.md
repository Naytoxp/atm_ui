# atm_ui

Hello everyone, I am releasing an updated and ATM UI like GTA:O using scaleform, working for ESX but easily configurablez

Features:
* Easily configurable
* Works perfectly with OneSync & OneSync Infinity

Notes:
* It is compatible at **least** with ESX 1.1.0 and ESX 1.2.0, but you should update your ESX to the latest version, and if it appear that a new version of ESX is not compatible, the script will be fixed.
* All the ATM are present

How to install:
1. Download the repo here [ATM:UI](https://github.com/Naytoxp/atm_ui)
2. Place the resource in your resource folder
3. Add "start atm_ui" to your server.cfg
4. Enjoy

Credits:
* Thanks a lot to teb - https://lsrp.cz, for helping me with the scaleform stuff
